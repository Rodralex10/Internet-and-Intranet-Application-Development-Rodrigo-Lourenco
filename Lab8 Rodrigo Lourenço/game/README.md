To be able to execute the hangman game, execute the services of docker-compose.yml, in order to create a container using the extension Apache.

After the container is created and its running on Docker Desktop, access to the link http://localhost:8080/index.html in order to execute the game!

The Hangman Game is made of 20 different Slovak Words, where the user got 6 attempts to try to reach the word pretended.

At the end of each game (win or lose), the user got the chance to restart in order to try to guess a new word.

Hope you enjoy!
